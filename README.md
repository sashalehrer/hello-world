# hello-world
Hi I'm Sasha! I am a 4th year Undergrad at UC Davis majoring in Sociology and minoring in Jewish Studies.
I currently hold a Social Media Coordination role for 77labs, and just finished working on my first consulting project for the firm working with The Deborah Project. I am also the Director of Social Media for the Aggies for Israel club at UC Davis. Additionally, I am a Campus Strategist for Perplexity AI and I am responsible for increasing student engagement, partnering with campus organizations, and planning/hosting events about Perplexity.
